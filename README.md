SURA is the radio transmission complex, representing itself as a structure which include three high-power transmitters, system of twelve phase shifters and antenna array with an area of 300 square meters.
This product has been developed as a program which may decide the problem of radiation patterns created by antenna array of SURA.
Product finally includes two programs: the first one does not account reflection from the Earth - condactivity of surface equals zero (that is radiation pattern of only emission-waves);
and another one does modelling radiation pattern as summa emission-waves and reflection-waves (that is condactivity equals infinite). 

COND = 0! The advantages of this approach are modeling and illustration the array factor as a clear figure, which could be different in dependence from the parameters of emissions,
such as: power, frequency, phase shift, polarization mode, rms value of amplitude and phase separately.

COND = inf! The version like this one does consider the reflection from Earth. The advantages of this approach are modeling and illustration the array factor, which close to real conditions. 
It could be different in dependence from the parameters of emissions, such as: power, frequency, phase shift, polarization mode, rms value of amplitude and phase separately, also like non-reflect model.
